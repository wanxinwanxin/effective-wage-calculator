‚Ä¢ Meta-analysis of 33 studies shows 20-35% CVD risk reduction from regular moderate exercise
‚Ä¢ Exercise adds ~2.5 years of life expectancy on average
‚Ä¢ Value of Statistical Life: ${health_benefits.get('value_statistical_life', 0):,} (EPA/DOT standard)

**Opportunity Cost Comparison:**
Your opportunity cost is ${opportunity_cost:.0f}/hour, making this activity ${ehw - opportunity_cost:+.2f}/hour relative to alternatives.
